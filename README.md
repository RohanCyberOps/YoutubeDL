Welcome to **YouTubeDL**! A sleek, user-friendly, and efficient tool to download YouTube videos in the best available quality. Powered by **yt-dlp**, this downloader ensures fast downloads, supports video formats, and can bypass most common restrictions.

## Features ✨
- **High-Quality Downloads**: Download videos in the best resolution available.
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports MP4, WEBM, and more.
- **Fast & Reliable**: Powered by `yt-dlp`, a powerful YouTube downloader.
- **Simple & Easy**: Just paste the URL and you're good to go!
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation 📦

### Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, and then run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

This will install the required **yt-dlp** library, which is at the core of the downloader.

## Usage 💡

### Simple Video Download
1. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python youtube_downloader.py
   ```
2. **Enter the YouTube Video URL** when prompted:
   ```bash
   Enter the YouTube video URL: https://youtu.be/your-video-url
   ```

The script will automatically download the video in the highest available quality and save it to your current working directory.

### Download Specific Format or Quality 🎞️
You can modify the `yt_dlp` options in the script to specify video formats and quality (HD, SD, etc.) to suit your needs.

## Example Code 📝

```python
import yt_dlp

url = input("Enter the YouTube video URL: ")

ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'best',  # Download the best quality available
}

try:
    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
        ydl.download([url])
    print("Download complete!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Options
- **best**: Download the best available quality.
- **worst**: Download the lowest quality.
- **mp4**: Download in MP4 format.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

If you encounter a **403 Forbidden error**, it might be due to age or region restrictions. You can:
- Use a **VPN** to bypass region-based restrictions.
- Ensure the video is **public** and not age-restricted.

If `yt-dlp` doesn't work with certain videos, it's always worth checking for updates:
```bash
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp
```
